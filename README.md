# CS205-Final-Project
Final Project
Goal: Parallelize Peter's Research Project 
Observe sea squirt that pumps blood in two directions to determine potential mathematical methods that govern the reversals within the heart, which would be tested through simulation.
Methods: random variation method and a controlled shifting method
Language: Used Python - but might be re-coding in C or transforming with Cython
