Goal: Parallelize Peter's Research Project 

Project research: Observe sea squirt that pumps blood in two directions to determine potential mathematical methods that govern the reversals within the heart, which would be tested through simulation.

Methods: random variation method and a controlled shifting method

Language: Used Python - but might be re-coding in C or transforming with Cython
